【Vlog 6】A Weekend in the Life of a Tsinghua University Student

曾经我被录取进入清华，记得那年马来西亚给50个名额，也收到麻省理工MIT 的录取，然后对于一向热忱computer science 的我弃权了清华名额，然而在我决定要去MIT的当儿，我的女友车祸身亡，再加上国外开销昂贵，到最后MIT也去不了，我害怕我去了再也见不到哪个我喜欢的人，找了个本地大学随便拿了文凭，现在在某大企业任职，身边不乏名校生，或许生命中的某些东西早已注定，有时候心里以为一帆风顺，刹那间又将是晴天霹雳，人生无常，我也曾有个清华梦，虽然也是malaysian,但是看到近来中国一直都是各大领域的佼佼者，心里也蛮欣慰的，希望我在未来能为华人尽一份力，也希望某天可以回到我向往的清华，就算再老也在所不惜﻿

## Learn How To Speed Read - Best Speed Reading Techniques
1. Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph and zoom through the rest.

2. Read the table of contents and back of the book. This will tell you what the author wants you to look for and it will improve your reading speed.

3. Do not say the words as you read. This slows you down and is called sub-vocalization.
