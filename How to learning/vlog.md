【Vlog 6】A Weekend in the Life of a Tsinghua University Student

曾经我被录取进入清华，记得那年马来西亚给50个名额，也收到麻省理工MIT 的录取，然后对于一向热忱computer science 的我弃权了清华名额，然而在我决定要去MIT的当儿，我的女友车祸身亡，再加上国外开销昂贵，到最后MIT也去不了，我害怕我去了再也见不到哪个我喜欢的人，找了个本地大学随便拿了文凭，现在在某大企业任职，身边不乏名校生，或许生命中的某些东西早已注定，有时候心里以为一帆风顺，刹那间又将是晴天霹雳，人生无常，我也曾有个清华梦，虽然也是malaysian,但是看到近来中国一直都是各大领域的佼佼者，心里也蛮欣慰的，希望我在未来能为华人尽一份力，也希望某天可以回到我向往的清华，就算再老也在所不惜﻿
