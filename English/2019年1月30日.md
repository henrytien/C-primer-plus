Nothing could assuage my fault.  
A small tranquil village.  
These changes did little to placate the union.  
I attempted to mollify her.  
I was absolutely seething.  
The falling snow muffle the sound of our footsteps.  
She exudes self-confidence.  
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.  
The water in the lake had been reduced to a trickle.  
Clara was tired and overwrought.  
the pool, wretched girl.  
Stop wriggling and let me put your T-shirt on.
