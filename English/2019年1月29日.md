She exercises every day to keep herself supple.  
Lulu was pliant in my arms.  
The strong lithe bodies of gymnasts.  
Don't do your job brooding all day.   
the debate about weather parents should smack their children.  
the economy is showing sign of flatering.  
I found myself floundering as I tried to answer her questions.  
a large, palcid baby
