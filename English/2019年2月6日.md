Looking at the starry sky; living down to the earth.

**sterile** a person or animal that is sterile cannot produce babies.  

**garrulous** always talking a lot.  

**gaiety**  when someone or something is cheerful and fun.

**euphoria** There was a general atmosphere of pessimism after the euphoria of last year.  

The plane just **destintergrate** in mid-air.

Two her fingers were **amptuated** becuase of frostbite.
